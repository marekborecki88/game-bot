# MAJOR TODOs
1. (In Progress) There should be mechanism to:
    - Scan villages
    - Prepare list of tasks for each village (with some forecasting level of resources in time, based on buildings costs instructions)
    - Take a list of tasks and create schedulable jobs with last job as prepare plan for next scan in interval from configuration
2. There should be defined policies for developing villages:
    - Balanced
    - Resource oriented
    - Military oriented (Defense/Offense)
    - Supporter (just support other account)
3. Would be great to be able to define policies in configuration


# MINOR TODOs
1. Extract static values into configuration
2. Introduce Interfaces to revert dependencies
